C++ Playground
=================
This is where I keep all my non project related C++ source codes. Its a simple repo for documenting my progress, all my trials and tribulations with C++. Explore it, review it, and comment. If you're interested in how I've used C++ to solve simple math problems, you may visit https://github.com/glennlopez/Archive.ProjectEuler

>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights..
