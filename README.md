C++ Playground
=================
This is where I keep all my non project related C and C++ source codes. Its an educational repo for documenting my progress; all my trials and tribulations with one of the "hardest" languages to master. Visit my [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/glennlopez?hr_r=1) and [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/f521b07f225156a74ce6fbd85a614e696228981) profiles to see the other ways I keep my C++ sharp. 

Recommended Computer Science Books:

Below is a link to a private-encrypted git repository for all the CS books I highly recommend (they are periodically updated). If you wish to clone the cs ebook repo, you'll need to have a **[Keybase account](https://keybase.io)** and have Keybase on your machine. 

> **Looking for zyBooks?** I've removed zyBooks chapters from this repo to avoid piracy complaints, but you can still access them from [older commit histories](https://github.com/glennlopez/Cpp.Playground/tree/222c9c6a2cd0b78a1befc62a4a301f3a948d3469/zyBooks), through [repo forks](https://github.com/glennlopez/Cpp.Playground/network/members), or through my private [keybase](https://keybase.io) repository below
