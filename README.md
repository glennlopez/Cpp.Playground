C++ Playground
=================
This is where I keep all my non project related C and C++ source codes. Its an educational repo for documenting my progress; all my trials and tribulations with one of the "hardest" languages to master. Visit my [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/glennlopez?hr_r=1) and [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/profile/f521b07f225156a74ce6fbd85a614e696228981) profiles to see the other ways I keep my C++ sharp. 

Computer Science e-Book Repository
==================
Due to popular demand and numerous DMCA notices, I've created a private encrypted git repository specifically for hosting compsci ebooks. You'll need to have a **Keybase account** and have Keybase on your machine before you can continue with the steps below.

**Ask to join our Keybase team:**
```
$ keybase team request-access hackup
```
> Note: You'll need to wait for me to accept your request before you can excecute the next command.

**Do a git clone of the private encrypted git repository:**
```
$ git clone keybase://team/hackup/cs-books
```
