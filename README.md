C++ Playground
=================
This is where I keep all my non project related C and C++ source codes. Its an educational repo for documenting my progress; all my trials and tribulations with one of the "hardest" languages to master. If you're interested, I have used project-euler (https://github.com/glennlopez/Archive.ProjectEuler) to benchmark my understanding with using C and C++ to solve math puzzles.
